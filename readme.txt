Just another way for despotic webmasters to control their users' content. This plugin filters out all inline styles referencing Comic Sans from posts.



== Description ==

The Wordpress community was understandably polarized by the shocking abuses of power represented by the `capital_P_dangit()` function inserted in core with version 3.0. Personally, I felt like it didn't go far enough. The same week, Cavs owner Dan Gilbert posted his incoherent "open letter" to NBA.com, cut-and-pasted from Microsoft Word with all the Word formatting spans still intact - including a font-family: Comic Sans declaration. Watching the world's reaction, I realized that WP site admins needed a filter which could prevent this.

If you have to ask...

= Any future upgrades planned? =

Funny you should ask... If anyone's interested, the obvious corollary to this is an option to moderate hostile comments by setting them in Comic Sans. I'll add that in if there's any interest.
